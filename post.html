							<h1>Bonjour Paris!</h1>
							<p>Thank you, Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know. Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings! Brave heart, Clara. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or, as I’ve always known him, Jeff. Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey?</p>
							<p>Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or, as I’ve always known him, Jeff. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. Bow ties are cool. Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. You are the only mystery worth solving. No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool.</p>

							<p>Can I talk about planets now? Shut up! Just shut up, shut up, shut up, shuttity up up up! I am totally against bantering. Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, need, game-player sort of person. I was being chased by a giant dinosaur, but I think I've managed to give it the slip. Oh, you've got a dinosaur too! Don't be lasagna. Be a pal and tell me, Am I a good man? You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was.</p>
							<p>I don't think that I'm a hugging person now. My carer. She cares so I don't have to. No sir. Thirteen! Clara, I'm not your boyfriend. I never said it was your mistake. You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Come on, Team Not Dead. You realise one of us is lying about our basic programming. And I think we both know which one that is. Mortuaries and larders. Easiest things to break out of.</p>
							<p>Au Revoir!</p>
